## üöÄ Overview

**mTrafficStats** is a macOS utility designed to give you full visibility into how your network connection is being used ‚Äî both incoming and outgoing ‚Äî with detailed statistics, real-time monitoring, and historical reports. It‚Äôs for anyone who wants to understand their bandwidth usage, monitor which apps are consuming data, spot unusual traffic, and make informed decisions about their network habits.

With mTrafficStats you can:

- See live data rates (upload/download) in your menu bar or in a small floating window, without needing to open a full-monitoring app.  
- Track total data used over specific periods: hourly, daily, weekly, monthly.  
- View per-application usage: know exactly which apps are consuming the most bandwidth.  
- Set limits or alerts to notify you if you exceed a certain data threshold.  
- Export usage logs for analysis or reporting.  

Whether you‚Äôre using a metered connection, travelling with mobile hotspots, or just want to make sure your network isn‚Äôt being abused, mTrafficStats offers both simplicity for casual users and enough detail for power users to dive deep.

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è About

mTrafficStats was developed to solve the common problem of ‚Äúnot knowing how much data I use‚Äù on macOS, especially under conditions where bandwidth matters: limited data plans, shared internet, or unpredictable mobile tethering. Unlike generic network monitors that only show speed or instantaneous rates, mTrafficStats focuses on **total usage over time** and transparency per application.

The app is built for macOS, using native frameworks wherever possible for efficiency and low resource use. It keeps background operations minimal so it doesn‚Äôt itself become a drag on battery or performance. The user interface is clean and unobtrusive, designed to provide information when you need it and stay out of the way when you don‚Äôt.  

You get detailed reporting, easy-to-read graphs of usage trends, and customization options ‚Äî such as choosing which network interface to monitor, defining billing cycles, and excluding certain apps from tracking. It also respects user privacy: data is stored locally, without third-party cloud uploads.
